# Deep multi task learning with low level tasks supervised at lower levels

By Anders Sogaard from University of Copenhagen

## Abstract
Earlier all task supervisions were on the same layer. The major contribution of this paper is that if there is a hierarchy present in the tasks that are being done.
The performance can be improved by using a similar hierarchy in the network. So, supervise the lower level tasks at lower layers.
