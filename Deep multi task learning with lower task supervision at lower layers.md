# Deep multi task learning with low level tasks supervised at lower levels

By Anders Sogaard from University of Copenhagen

## Abstract
- Earlier all task supervisions were on the same layer. 
- The major contribution of this paper is that if there is a hierarchy present in the tasks that are being done.
- The performance can be improved by using a similar hierarchy in the network. So, supervise the lower level tasks at lower layers.

## Model
- Task: Sequence tagging using deep BiLSTM
### Deep bi-RNNs
