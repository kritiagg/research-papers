## Notes:
- How do these sytems give rise to syntax?
- This paper : probes the structural features encoded in language model by evaluating its ability to leverage them for transfer across languages and data types like music etc.
- Train LM on multiple types of data and then test on language to see what type of data generalizes the best for the language.
- Finding the representations that work the best across languages.
